# Gender in Academia

## Project Overview
"Gender in Academia" is a collaborative research project on gender discrimination in the allocation of research grants in Swedish academia. This project is a joint effort between Professor Anna Dreber, Karin Hederos, Anna Trolle Sandberg (Researchers at SOFI, Stockholm University), and Jonas Olofsson, Professor at the Psychology Department of Stockholm University, and Jeffrey Clark.

## Data
The project utilizes a dataset of approximately 27,000 research grant applications from the Vetenskapsrådet (Swedish Research Council). This dataset includes:
- A summarized Excel sheet of the applications (not shared publicly).
- Attached publication lists of each application in PDF format (not shared publicly).

## Work Completed
1. **Web Scraping**: Scripts developed for scraping dissertation years from the Swedish Royal Library database Libris.
2. **Publication Lists Processing**: Advanced OCR (tesseract) parsing scripts to extract separate entries from publication lists in PDF format. These extracted entries are then fuzzy matched with publications from Clarivate’s Web of Science database.

## Current Focus
- Refining OCR techniques to effectively separate publications in the heterogeneously formatted documents.
- Enhancing data matching processes with citation data from Clarivate.
